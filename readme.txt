Project Description

“PyGarageBand” is essentially an audio manipulating program made using python. It seeks to emulate GarageBand by letting the user create their own music by importing .wav files, modifying them, creating them, and combining them all together. There are two main screens that the user toggles between; one where users can gather the audios they wish to use, and the other where they can manipulate the files and play them back.

How to Run

The python file tp3.py should be in the same directory as the following files:
- lilbutton.png
-instrument2.png
-helpImage1.png
-helpImage2.png
-helpButton.png
-playFinal.png
-pauseFinal.png
-stopFinal.png

The following audios also need to be in the same directory as tp3.py and can be accessed at the following link (make sure fileNames are NOT changed!):

(Anyone with Carnegie Mellon account should be able to see)

-guitarChords3.wav
-drumbeatFinal.wav
-pianoChords3.wav
-hannahmontana.wav (optional)

-any wav file wished to be imported by user
** make sure that all .wav files used in PyGarageBand have the same parameters (specifically, bits per sample). Otherwise, the playback in Step 2 will be extremely distorted. A good external program to use to convert .wav files to the same sample width is 'Max'**

Every other feature of PyGarageBand should be fairly straightforward. The program will crash if particular nonsensical inputs are placed in the user entries within the program.
